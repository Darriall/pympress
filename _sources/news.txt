2009-11-10: pympress 0.3 is out!
--------------------------------

**pympress 0.3** was published a few days ago. You can get it from the
:doc:`download page <download>`.

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* "goto slide": clicking the current slide number in the Presenter window turns
  the label into a text entry field when you can enter a slide number to jump to
* faster pages rendering in the Presenter window

Bugfixes and minor changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* repsect `PEP 8`_
* better detection of icon path

Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^

We've got pympress to work on Mac OS X! But it was quite tricky, due to some
weird installation paths for Python, PyGTK, etc. in DarwinPorts. I will try to
write an installation guide for this OS one day, but since I don't have a Mac,
this may take quite a while. Meanwhile I can try to help you if you have
specific questions, so don't hesitate to :doc:`ask <contact>`!

.. _PEP 8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
